# Rails::Jquery::Form::Validator

Jquery-form-validator-rails gem is based on Victor Jonsson's jQuery plugin: https://github.com/victorjonsson/jQuery-Form-Validator

jQuery Form Validator is a feature rich and multilingual jQuery plugin that makes it easy to validate user input while keeping your HTML markup clean from javascript code. Even though this plugin has a wide range of validation functions it's designed to require as little network traffic as possible. This is achieved by grouping together validation functions in "modules", making it possible to load only those functions that's needed to validate a particular form.
